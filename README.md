# 🎮 Swift Playground: Learn to Code Game

An interactive Swift Playground iPad game designed to help kids learn Swift programming in a fun and intuitive way! Navigate a character using code to complete challenges and levels.

## 🧠 Project Description

This project uses `SpriteKit` to create a simple 2D grid world where kids can move a character using Swift functions. As they type code like `move("up")`, the character moves and interacts with the environment. It’s an engaging way to teach basic control flow, logic, and sequencing to young learners.
